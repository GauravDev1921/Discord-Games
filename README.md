## The basic usage of the library goes like this
- Import the specific game `class` from the library
    - Ex: `from discord_games import Wordle`
- Initialize the game class (with the appropriate arguments, normally none but varies from game to game)
    - Ex: `game = Wordle()`
- Call the start method (with the appropriate arguments) to start the game
    - Ex: `await game.start(ctx)` (ctx is always a required argument, rest are optional)<br/>
- refer to the source for more info on the arguments you *could* pass
